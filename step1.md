Apache Cassandra™ is an *open-source* *distributed NoSQL database* that delivers 
continuous *availability*, high *performance*, and linear *scalability*. Cassandra is suited equally well for 
*on-prem*, *multi-cloud* and *hybrid-cloud* deployments.

Hundreds of enterprises choose Cassandra as the main persistence layer for their modern *data-driven* and *cloud-native applications*. 
Some of the most important benefits of using Cassandra include:
- Cassandra's availability supports *mission-critical* applications 
- Cassandra's performance and scalability translate to *high-throughput* and *high-volume* applications 
- Cassandra's data distribution and replication enable *global presence* and *workload separation*  
- Cassandra's multi-cloud and hybrid-cloud capabilities mean *zero lock-in* and *workload mobility*
